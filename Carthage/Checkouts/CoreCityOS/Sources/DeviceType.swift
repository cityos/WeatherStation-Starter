    ```swift
    struct Lamp: DeviceType {
        var deviceData: DeviceData = DeviceData(deviceID: "abc-123")
        var creationDate = NSDate()
        var location: DeviceLocation?
        var dataCollection = CustomLampDataCollection()

    }
    ```

    var creationDate: NSDate? { get set }
